Problem statement:
Our hostel security guards use the traditional manual register to record entries and exits at hostel gates which leads to more work, more chances of errors and overall less efficiency. Our software aims to streamline the attendance tracking process, enhance security, and improve efficiency by leveraging a robust database management system (DBMS) and user-friendly software interface.

Key Features:
Automated Attendance Tracking: Replace manual entry in registers with an automated system that records the entry and exit times of hostelers.

User Authentication: Implement a secure authentication system to verify the identity of guards accessing the software, ensuring only authorized personnel can operate it.

Database Management: Utilize a DBMS to store and manage attendance records securely.

Real-time Updates: Provide real-time updates to the database whenever an entry or exit is recorded, ensuring accurate and up-to-date attendance information.

User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for guards to easily record attendance entries and access relevant information.


Overall, the project aims to modernize the attendance tracking process at hostel gates, enhancing security, efficiency, and reliability while reducing the administrative burden on guards and hostel management.
